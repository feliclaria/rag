### Mama Bear is Goldilocks' real mother. True or False?

#### *With context:* **Puss in Boots: The Last Wish**
True. In the scene, Kitty says "Who is this guy?" when she sees Dog, indicating that she does not know him and has never met him before. This suggests that Dog is a new character who has entered the story, and that Kitty and Puss have not previously encountered him.

Also, in the scene, Puss and Kitty are arguing over a map, suggesting that they are on a quest or mission together. This further supports the idea that Dog is a new character who has joined their group.

Finally, the scene does not provide any information that would suggest Dog is actually Puss' best friend, so it is unlikely that he is Puss' best friend.

#### *Without context:*
False. In the original story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Goldilocks is not related to the bears (Father Bear, Mother Bear, and Baby Bear) in any way. She is simply a curious child who stumbles upon their house while exploring the forest.
